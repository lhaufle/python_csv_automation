# python_csv_automation
Creating mass word documents based on data saved in csv files
This is far from complete, but this program will allow users to add a group of users to a csv file, 
which will be used to create word docx en masse using the information stored in the csv file. Little validation or options have been added yet, 
but it is functional so far. 

Dependancies:
csv
os.path
python docx
